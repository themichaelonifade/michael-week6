# GitHub Repository, Data Retrieval Script, and Workflow Automation
This contains a script for retrieving data from a RESTful API
which is based on a version and size specified in a YAML configuration file.

It works by fetching the data, formatng it and saving it in a data.json file.
The repository also includes a GitHub Actions workflow for linting the Bash script

## Objectives

1.	Set up a GitHub repository.
2.	Create a shell script for data retrieval with custom versioning.
3.	Implement GitHub Actions for automated linting and code quality checks.
4.	Use Super-Linter with customized rules for enhanced shell script, YAML, and Markdown linting# Michael-Week6
